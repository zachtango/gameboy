Happy Halloween!

I'm finally able to start on my original GameBoy emulator after being so busy with exams and interviews. I will be gbdev.io as my reference
to figure out what specs I need to emulate. My goal for today is to get started on emulating the GameBoy CPU and instruction set.

## CPU Specs
The GameBoy CPU is 8 bits, meaning it usually deals with bits in chunks of 8 bits or 1 byte. Therefore, the registers will be 8 bits and
the instructions will be 8 bits as well. The address range will by from [0, 2^8 - 1].
